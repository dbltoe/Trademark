# Trademark
**Adds a Trademark to the Main Page Nav Bar and Mobile Nav Bars**

A recent client had a requirement for their trademark to be plainly shown on all pages of their Zen Cart website. The best answer was to add it to the navMainWrapper in front of the default "Home" declaration for the desktop view and immediately opposite the "hamburger" on the mobile/tablet menu.  The lawyers say that there is no need for the TM or R symbol.  Just the company name will do whether it is truly a registered trademark or not.

This mod has two folders, one for stores using the Zen Cart supplied responsive_classic template (or its clone) and the other for the addon [ZCA Bootstrap Template](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=2191https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=2191) by lat9 (or its clone).  Versions 3.4.0 thru 3.6.0 of the ZCA Bootstrap template are covered by this mod

Each folder has a ReadMe with instructions for that particular template.  Once you've read the instructions select the folder corresponding to your current version of Zen Cart and follow the instructions in that templates ReadMe for installation.

NOTE:  If you have not yet cloned your bootstrap or responsive_classic template, we recommend you do that before you install this mod.  Get lat9's excellent [Clone a Template](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=2087) to do the job.

As always, no warranty or guarantee is applied or implied.

**ALWAYS MAKE BACKUPS BEFORE ADDING/EDITING ANY MOD.**
