# Trademark
## Adds a Trademark to the Main Page Nav Bar and Mobile Nav Bars
### The Story Behind the Creation
A client required their trademark to be plainly shown on all pages of their Zen Cart website. Most of our sites do not use the logoWrapper to show more of the product on a page.  The site's logo is generally moved to the define_main_page.php.  The best solution we found was to add it to the navMainWrapper, in front of the default "Home" declaration for the desktop view, and immediately opposite the "hamburger" on the mobile/tablet menu.  The lawyers say that there is no need for the TM or R symbol.  Just the company name will do whether it is truly a registered trademark or not.

### Installation
This mod has two folders, one for stores using the Zen Cart supplied responsive_classic template (or its clone) and the other for the addon [ZCA Bootstrap Template](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=2191) by lat9 (or its clone).  Versions 3.4.0 through 3.7.8 of the ZCA Bootstrap template are covered by this mod.

**Note:** Support of Zen Cart versions before 1.5.8 are not supported with ZCA Bootstrap versions 3.7.1 and newer.

Each folder contains a ReadMe file with instructions specific to that template.  Once you've read the instructions, select the folder corresponding to your current version of Zen Cart and follow the instructions in that template's ReadMe for installation.

**NOTE:** If you have not yet cloned your bootstrap or responsive_classic template, we recommend you do that before you install this mod.  Get lat9's excellent [Clone a Template](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=2087) to do the job.

As always, no warranty or guarantee is applied or implied.

**ALWAYS MAKE BACKUPS BEFORE ADDING/EDITING ANY MOD.**
